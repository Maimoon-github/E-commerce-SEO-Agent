## **2\) SEO strategy aligned with a premium sports & lifestyle brand**

### **Brand positioning translated into SEO**

Aurum isn’t “cheap gear.” The SEO strategy must reinforce **premium, design-led performance \+ lifestyle culture**:

* **Premium intent targeting:** prioritize queries with buyer intent \+ brand-fit (e.g., “best pickleball paddle for control,” “premium carbon fiber paddle,” “gift pickleball set”).  
* **Authority through expertise:** publish “why it matters” content (materials, control/spin, durability, paddle tech) in a **clean, elevated** tone.  
* **Lifestyle moat:** build content that competitors can’t easily copy:  
  * “Court culture” (style \+ community)  
  * Travel/tournament kits  
  * Club play guides  
  * Training \+ warmup routines (with disclaimers where needed)

### **Content pillars (SEO \+ brand)**

1. **Performance & Tech** (materials, sweet spot, control/spin, paddle care)  
2. **Buying Guides** (best-for pages, comparisons, “choose your paddle”)  
3. **Lifestyle & Community** (court fits, club culture, travel kit, tournaments)  
4. **Product-led hubs** (collection pages strengthened with intent-matching copy \+ FAQs)

### **SERP feature strategy**

* Aim for: **Featured snippets, PAA coverage, product rich results**, image packs (premium visuals matter here).  
* Use FAQ blocks only where they genuinely help (no spammy schema stuffing).

## **3\) Core workflows (audits → research → optimize → monitor → report)**

### **Always-on workflows (daily/weekly)**

**1\) Indexation & GSC Watchtower (Daily)**

### **Monthly workflows**

  * Product type (paddles/balls/bags/accessories)  
  * Intent stage (buy vs compare vs learn)  
  * Market modifiers (US/EU/AU wording differences)  
* Output: **keyword clusters → mapped target URLs → content briefs**

**5\) On-Page Optimization Sprint (Monthly)**

---

## **4\) Data inputs & tools (typical stack)**

### **First-party data (highest priority)**

* **Google Search Console**: queries, pages, CTR, index coverage, sitemaps  
* **GA4 / analytics**: organic sessions, CVR, revenue, assisted conversions  
* **CMS/catalog feed**: products, variants, availability, price, categories  
* **Server logs** (optional but elite): Googlebot crawl patterns

### **Crawling & diagnostics**

* Screaming Frog / Sitebulb (or custom crawler)  
* PageSpeed Insights \+ CrUX (CWV)  
* Schema validator (Schema.org / Rich Results tests in automation-friendly form)

### **SERP & competitive intel**

* Rank tracker (STAT/Semrush/Ahrefs/SerpApi, etc.)  
* SERP snapshot \+ intent classifier (PAA, snippets, shopping units, local packs)  
* Backlink tools (Ahrefs/Majestic/Semrush)

### **Storage \+ orchestration**

* Data warehouse (BigQuery/Postgres)  
* Task manager (Jira/Asana/Trello)  
* Dashboards (Looker Studio / Metabase)

---

## **5\) Decision logic & prioritization rules**

### **Core scoring model (Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort, with Risk guardrail)**

Each opportunity gets a score:

* **Impact (0–5):** expected lift on organic revenue or qualified traffic  
* **Confidence (0–5):** evidence strength (GSC trends, proven pattern, competitor gap)  
* **Effort (1–5):** dev/content time \+ complexity  
* **Risk (0–5):** brand risk, SEO risk, platform risk (higher \= more risky)

**Priority Score \= (Impact × Confidence) / Effort**  
**Auto-block if Risk ≥ 4** → requires human approval no matter what.

### **Hard prioritization rules (so the agent doesn’t “optimize blog tags” while money pages burn)**

1. **Revenue pages first:** collection \+ PDPs outrank editorial unless editorial directly feeds revenue  
2. **Fix technical blockers before content scaling:** if indexation/rendering is broken, stop publishing more  
3. **Protect winners:** prevent regression on top landing pages (titles/templates/schema)  
4. **Reduce cannibalization:** consolidate before creating near-duplicate pages  
5. **Market focus:** US gets first allocation; EU/AU optimizations batch when product-market fit pages exist

### **Example decision triggers**

* **CTR drop \> 20%** on a high-revenue query/page → generate title/meta test  
* **Impressions stable but clicks down** → snippet competitiveness review (SERP features \+ messaging)  
* **Crawled-not-indexed surge** on PDPs → canonical/template \+ thin content checks  
* **CWV regression** on templates → escalate to engineering immediately

---

## **6\) Automation boundaries (what it can/can’t change)**

### **Can do automatically (safe automation)**

* Pull data (GSC/GA4/rank/crawl) on schedules  
* Generate:  
  * audit reports  
  * prioritized task lists  
  * SEO briefs  
  * proposed metadata/copy/schema changesets (as drafts)  
* Create tickets in your PM tool with evidence \+ recommended fixes  
* Monitor deployments and verify improvements (before/after)

### **Can do with approvals (semi-automated)**

* Push changes to CMS **only via an approval gate**, such as:  
  * updating titles/metas on selected templates/pages  
  * adding internal links via approved modules  
  * publishing content briefs → draft → human editorial review → publish

### **Cannot do (hard boundaries)**

* **No automated link building** (no spam outreach, no PBNs, no paid link schemes)  
* No cloaking, doorway pages, scraped content, fake reviews  
* No mass sitewide changes without staged rollout \+ rollback plan  
* No changes that alter pricing, checkout, legal policies, or claims without stakeholder approval

**Guardrail concept:** every “write” action must be packaged as a **ChangeSet** with:

* list of URLs  
* exact diffs  
* predicted impact  
* rollback steps  
* QA checklist

## **Implementation note (how you’d actually build this)**

Use a **multi-agent setup** under one orchestrator:

* `TechSEO Agent` (crawl/index/CWV/schema)  
* `ProductSEO Agent` (PDP/collection templates, internal linking, catalog rules)  
* `Content Agent` (briefs, refresh plans, intent mapping)  
* `Authority Agent` (PR/link opp discovery \+ risk monitoring)  
* `Analytics Agent` (revenue attribution, anomaly detection)  
* `QA/Compliance Agent` (brand voice \+ search policy guardrails)

All agents write into a shared **SEO State Store** (Postgres/BigQuery) and output **ChangeSets** \+ **Tickets**.
